		<h2>8 Golden Rules of Interface Design</h2>
        
		<p>Ben Shneiderman (born August 21, 1947) is an American computer scientist and professor at the University of 
		Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab. In his famous book “Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective 
		Human-Computer Interaction”, Shneiderman revealed these 8 golden rules of interface design.  </p>

		<h2>What are this 8 Golden Rules?</h2>

        <p> So there are 8 main golden rules of interface design to take in account, that are:</p>
		<p> 1.- STRIVE FOR CONSISTENCY:
		<p>	Consistent interfaces means using not only the same design patterns but also similar 
		    situations for sequences of actions. This refers to the correct use of color, typography, commands…</p>

		<p> 2.- SEEK UNIVERSAL USABILITY:
		<p>	Recognize the needs of diverse users and design for plasticity, facilitating transformation of content. 
			You have to put functions that experts could use, but you have to make it friendly-use to those novice.<p>

		<p> 3.- OFFER INFORMATIVE FEEDBACK:
		<p>	You need to keep your users informed of what’s happening at every stage of your process. It should be meaningful, 
			relevant, and also clear.<p>

		<p> 4.- DESIGN DIALOGUES TO YIELD CLOSURE:
		<p>	You have to organise a sequence of actions, a beginning, a middle, and an end, that users must follow. For example, 
			e-commerce websites move users from product selection to the checkout and then to a different page that confirms the transaction.<p>

		<p> 5.- PREVENT ERRORS:
		<p> A proper way to avoid errors as much as possible is to have a good interface that allows you not to. But when errors do happen, your 
			system needs to make it easy for the user to understand the type of problem and allow him to know how to fix it.<p>

		<p> 6.- PERMIT EASY REVERSAL:
		<p>	Users need to have a cancel option or a button to go back, just in case they made something they didn’t want to or simply if they made 
			a missed click.<p>
		<p><img src="images/foto 6.png"></p>

		<p> 7.- KEEP USERS IN CONTROL:
		<p>	It is important to provide control and freedom to your users. Users should be the main initiators of actions rather than the responders 
			avoiding in this case surprises, interruptions or anything that has not been requested by them.</p>
		<p><img src="images/foto 7.png"></p>

		<p> 8.- REDUCE SHORT-TERM MEMORY LOAD:
		<p>	Our capacity to pay attention is limited, so we have to make our users’ work easier. You can do it, for example, showing them different products 
			they have already bought or seen. This could help in order to make your interface simple and consistent.</p>
